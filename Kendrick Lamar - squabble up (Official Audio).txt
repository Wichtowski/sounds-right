God knows
I am reincarnated
I was stargazin'
Life goes on, I need all my babies (Gyah, gyah)

Woke up lookin' for the broccoli
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me
Mr. Get Off, I get off and mop feet
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, now is your chance
A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state
Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but shе don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safе
Mando, let me know what the play

What the fuck?
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up
Fallin' from a money tree and it grow throughout the months
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off, yeah, it's us

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up

Hol' up (Hol' up)
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Bye, bitch (Bye, bitch)
I'm finna go dumb (Finna go dumb)
Sideways (Sideways)
Bunk skunk (Bunk skunk)
Fever (Fever)
I'm on one (I'm on one)

Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it
Quid pro quo, what you want? 'Cause I'm watchin' it
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was woof tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Blacky Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
"Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?" I'm like, "Nigga, nah"
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog (Ah)

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up
